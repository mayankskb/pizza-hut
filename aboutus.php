			<b>Pizza Hut History</b><br/><br/>

			   In 1958, Frank and Dan Carney had an idea for a great local pizza<br>
			   restaurant in Wichita Kansas. When a friend suggested opening a<br>
			   pizza parlor--then a rarity--they agreed that the idea could prove<br>
			   successful, and they borrowed $600 from their mother to start a<br>
			   business with partner John Bender.<br><br>
			   Renting a small building at 503 South Bluff in downtown Wichita<br>
			   and purchasing secondhand equipment to make pizzas, the Carneys<br/>
			   and Bender opened the first Pizza Hut restaurant; on opening night,<br/>
			   they gave pizza away to encourage community interest. The small 25<br/>
			   seat restaurant only had room for 9 letters on the sign… the building<br/>
			   looked like a hut… so 'Pizza Hut' was born!<br/><br/>
			   A year later, in 1959, Pizza Hut was incorporated in Kansas, and<br/>
			   Dick Hassur opened the first franchise unit in Topeka, Kansas.<br/>
			   Fifteen years later, we opened the first UK restaurant and since then<br/>
			   we've become the biggest Pizza Company on the planet!<br/><br/>
			   A subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc., the company oversees more than<br/>
			   11,000 pizza restaurants and delivery outlets in 90 countries<br/>
			   worldwide.<br/><br/>
